# Black-Jack

DESCRIPTION
########################################################
This game was an assignment for a Java training. As this training takes place in the Netherlands, most (if not all) the text in the game is in Dutch.
It is a simple Black Jack game. 
Currently it allows for only one player (you) and the dealer.
Gambling is not (yet) implemented, nor is splitting.


RUNNING THE GAME
########################################################

To start the game either use a Java IDE (such as IntelliJ or Eclipse) and run the project from Game.java.
The game can also be run from the cmd prompt.
To do so, follow these steps:

1. Copy the files to a folder (for example, in a BlackJack folder on your desktop)
2. Navigate to said folder
3. Open cmd: (win + r) type 'cmd' in the prompt that opens and press enter
4. Copy the path to whichever folder you put the game files in (all the .java files)
5. In the cmd type: "cd" + the folderpath. Do this with either ctrl + v or right click
6. Type "javac Game.java"
7. Type "java Game"
